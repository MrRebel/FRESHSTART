# FRESHSTART
FRESHSTART is an implementation of lwjgl and slick2d into a more robust
and user friendly OpenGL Entity-Based game engine.

#Dependencies
FRESHSTART requires the Light Weight Java Game Library and Slick2d which are
included in the Repository and already used in the buildpath.

#IDEs
I would suggest using Eclipse for easy switching between the natives 
necessary for your computer. While other IDEs can also be used I would 
suggest Eclipse.
